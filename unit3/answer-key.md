## Answer Key

1. **Measures of central tendency** attempt to find a center point of the data, while **measures of dispersion** quantify how much the data is spread out around the mean. Measures of central tendency include mean, median, and mode, while measures of dispersion include variance and standard deviation.
   
2. A **population (N)** includes all individuals in a group, while a **sample (n)** is a subset of a population used to represent the larger group.

3. A **deviation** is the distance between a single data point and the mean of the data set. It represents how much that specific data point differs from the average.

4. Squaring the deviations ensures all values are positive, making calculations cleaner. It also magnifies larger deviations, giving them a greater influence on the variance.

5. **Larger squared deviations** have a greater effect on the variance, indicating that the data points are more spread out. On the other hand, **smaller squared deviations** contribute less to the overall variance, signifying data that is more clustered around the mean.

6. **Variance** and **standard deviation** are related in that standard deviation is the square root of the variance. This provides an interpretation of the spread of the data in the same units as the original data.

7. **Standard deviation** is preferred because its units match the units of the mean and the original data set, making the two values easier to interpret and compare.

8. The denominator in the sample variance calculation is **n-1** to correct for a bias introduced when using the sample mean. Using n-1 helps provide a more accurate estimate of population variance.

9. A small **standard deviation** indicates that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean, suggesting less variability or spread in the data set.

10. If the data set is in meters, the **variance** would be in square meters (mÂ²), while the **standard deviation** would be in meters (m).

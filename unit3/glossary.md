## Glossary of Key Terms

- **Central Tendency**: Measures that indicate the center or typical value of a data set (e.g., mean, median, mode).
- **Dispersion**: Measures that quantify the spread or variability of data points around the mean (e.g., variance, standard deviation).
- **Population (N)**: The entire group of individuals or items that are being studied.
- **Sample (n)**: A subset of a population that is used to represent the larger group.
- **Population Mean (μ)**: The average value of all data points in a population.
- **Sample Mean (x̄)**: The average value of all data points in a sample.
- **Deviation**: The distance between a single data point and the mean of the data set.
- **Squared Deviation**: The deviation squared, used in variance calculations to ensure positive values and magnify larger deviations.
- **Variance (σ² or s²)**: A measure of how spread out the data is around the mean; the average of the squared deviations.
- **Standard Deviation (σ or s)**: The square root of the variance; it provides a measure of the dispersion of data in the same units as the original data.
- **Bias**: The tendency of a statistical method to systematically overestimate or underestimate the true population parameter. Dividing by n-1 in the sample variance formula helps correct this type of bias.

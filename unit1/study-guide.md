# Study Guide: Core Data Concepts

### Formal Definition of Data
Data is formally defined as collected observations and information about something, which can be either structured or unstructured. This encompasses a broad range of information, from numerical measurements to qualitative descriptions.

### Continuous vs. Discrete Data
- **Continuous Data**: Can take any value within a range (e.g., height or weight).
- **Discrete Data**: Can only take specific, distinct values (e.g., car models, dice rolls).

### Numeric Data
Numeric data is not always discrete. For example, passenger classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd) are numeric and ordered but not continuous.

### Nominal vs. Ordinal Data
- **Nominal Data**: Categorical without order (e.g., animal species).
- **Ordinal Data**: Categorical with a natural order (e.g., passenger classes).

### Structured vs. Unstructured Data
- **Structured Data**: Organized in a predefined format (e.g., SQL databases).
- **Unstructured Data**: No predefined structure (e.g., audio, video).

### Challenges of Unstructured Data
Unstructured data requires complex analysis methods, such as machine learning models, to extract insights.

### Population vs. Sample Data
- **Population Data**: Every member of a defined group.
- **Sample Data**: A subset of the population, used for analysis when full data isn't feasible.

### Representative Sample
A sample is representative if it accurately reflects the characteristics of the population, reducing bias.

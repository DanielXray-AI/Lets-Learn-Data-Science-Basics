# Glossary: Measures of Central Tendency

### Central Tendency
The central or typical value around which a data set clusters. It includes the mean, median, and mode.

---

### Mean
The average of a data set, calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values. 
- Formula: \( \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} \)
- **Population Mean**: Represented by \( \mu \).
- **Sample Mean**: Represented by \( \bar{x} \).

---

### Median
The middle value of an ordered data set. If the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

---

### Mode
The most frequently occurring value in a data set. A data set can be unimodal, bimodal, or have no mode.

---

### Weighted Mean
An average where some data points contribute more heavily than others, based on assigned weights.
- Formula: \( \text{Weighted Mean} = \frac{\sum (w_i \cdot x_i)}{\sum w_i} \)
  - \( w_i \): Weights assigned to each data point.

---

### Truncated Mean
The mean calculated after removing a specified percentage of the smallest and largest data points to reduce the impact of outliers.

---

### Outliers
Extreme values in a data set that differ significantly from the majority of the data.

---

### Population
The entire group being studied or analyzed. For example, all residents of a city.

---

### Sample
A subset of the population used for analysis when studying the entire population is impractical or impossible.

---

### Bimodal
A data set that has two values appearing with the same greatest frequency.

---

### Skewed Data
A data set where values are not symmetrically distributed, often resulting in a mean that is not central to the data.

---

### Continuous Data
Data that can take any value within a range, such as height or weight.

---

### Discrete Data
Data that can only take specific, distinct values, such as the number of students in a classroom.

---

### Symmetry
A property of a data set where values are evenly distributed around the center.

---

### Variability
The extent to which data points in a data set differ from each other or from the mean.

---

### Frequency Distribution
A summary that shows how often each value occurs in a data set.

---

### Nominal Data
Categorical data without a natural order, such as colors or names.

---

### Ordinal Data
Categorical data with a natural order, such as rankings (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd).
